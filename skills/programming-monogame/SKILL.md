# MonoGame.Extended Documentation Reference

## Overview

Quick reference index for MonoGame.Extended documentation. Local markdown files are stored in the `references/` subdirectory.

**This skill contains ONLY file paths, not documentation.** You MUST use Read to retrieve the actual docs.

## Workflow (REQUIRED)

**CRITICAL:** This skill is a file path index ONLY. You MUST use Read to get actual documentation.

1. Find relevant file path(s) in Quick Reference table below
2. **Call Read tool** with the file path from the table
3. Extract information from Read results
4. Answer using the documentation content

**Example:**
```
User asks: "How do I use Texture2DAtlas?"
Step 1: Find file path in table → references/texture-handling/texture2datlas/texture2datlas.md
Step 2: Read("/home/.../programming-monogame/references/texture-handling/texture2datlas/texture2datlas.md")
Step 3: Use Read results to answer
```

**DO NOT:**
- Answer questions without calling Read first
- Make up API details not in the documentation files
- Use prior knowledge instead of current docs

## Using Read

For each relevant file path, construct the absolute path and read it:

```
Read(
  file_path: "/home/.../programming-monogame/references/[feature]/[feature].md"
)
```

**Note:** You'll need to construct the absolute path based on the current working directory. The skill files are located at `.claude/skills/programming-monogame/` relative to the repository root.

## Common Patterns

**Multiple Related Features:**
Read all related files in parallel. Example for textures:
1. Texture2DAtlas (atlas creation)
2. Texture2DRegion (single region)
3. Sprite (rendering)

**Hierarchical Features:**
Start with overview, then read sub-pages. Example for particles:
1. quick_start_guide (overview)
2. emission_profiles (specific need)
3. modifiers (specific need)

## When NOT to Use

- MonoGame core classes (GraphicsDevice, SpriteBatch, etc.) - use MonoGame docs
- Third-party libraries (TexturePacker, Tiled editor) - use their docs
- General C# questions - standard resources apply
